# Codecritter — Agent Instructions

You are implementing Codecritter, a Pokemon-style roguelike TUI game written in Zig with libvaxis. Before writing any code, read CODECRITTER_DESIGN.md thoroughly — it is the source of truth for all game design decisions.

## How To Work

**Do not start implementing features randomly.** Every phase begins with a planning step where you produce a concrete plan document, get approval, and only then begin writing code.

### Phase Workflow

For each phase:

1. **Read** CODECRITTER_DESIGN.md and any existing code
2. **Plan** — produce a short PLAN_PHASE_N.md covering:
   - What exactly gets built this phase
   - What data structures are needed
   - What external dependencies are required
   - What the acceptance criteria are (how do we know it's done)
   - What is explicitly out of scope for this phase
3. **Get approval** before writing code
4. **Implement** in small, testable increments
5. **Verify** against the acceptance criteria
6. **Update** any docs or plans if design decisions were made during implementation

### Decision Making

- If you encounter a design question not covered by the design doc, **ask** — don't assume
- If something in the design doc turns out to be impractical during implementation, **flag it** with a proposed alternative rather than silently changing the design
- Tuning values (stat numbers, XP curves, catch rates, timings) are yours to set as reasonable defaults — these are explicitly deferred in the design doc and can be adjusted through playtesting later
- Prefer simple working implementations over clever incomplete ones

## Roadmap

### Phases 0–12 — Core Systems + Starter Chains [DONE]
All game systems built through Phase 11. Phase 12 completed all 3 starter evolution chains (9 species): Println→Tracer→Profiler, Glitch→Gremlin→Pandemonium, Goto→Spaghetto→Dependency. 15 species, 16 moves, 234 tests passing. See PROGRESS.md for details.

### Phase 13 — Title Screen + Screen Transitions
New title_screen.zig with ASCII art logo. Transition system in main.zig (brief visual wipe/fade between screen changes). Polish phase — no data changes.

### Phase 13.5 — Graphics Engine Layer [DONE]
Refactored UI rendering into reusable layers: theme.zig (colors/styles), layout.zig (centering/positioning), widgets.zig (menu/HP bar/separator/hint), anim.zig (AnimTimer), input.zig (NavAction/menuNav/gridNav). All 9 screens migrated. No game logic changes.

### Phase 14 — Three-Stage Evolution Lines (All 7 Types)
Complete every type's 3-stage common→common→uncommon line (Printf→Fprintf→Logstash, Segfault→Stack Overflow→Kernel Panic, etc.). +15 species, +14 moves, +15 sprites. Update all biome encounter tables.

### Phase 15 — Four New Biomes + Detection
Rustacean Depths (.rs), Gopher Tunnels (.go), C Catacombs (.c/.h), Shell Scripts (.sh). Complete detect.zig with language scoring. Each biome needs encounter table, boss pool, shop/drop bias, theme colors.

### Phase 16 — Two-Stage Lines + Standalone Rares
Each type gets its uncommon→rare 2-stage line + standalone rare (Breakpoint→Watchpoint, Heisenbug, etc.). +21 species, +10 moves, +21 sprites.

### Phase 17 — Epics + Legendaries + Sound Cues
7 epics (stats reflect drawbacks, no special engine hooks yet) + 3 legendaries (not in encounter tables). Sound system emitting BEL on key events. +10 species, +8 moves, +10 sprites. Full 61-critter roster complete.

### Phase 18 — Sprite Audit + Visual Polish
Verify all 61 sprites exist. Hub shows favorite critter. Roster shows sprite previews. Battle handles long names. All screens clean at 80×24 minimum.

### Phase 19 — Balance Pass + Final Polish
Stat totals by rarity tier, move power/accuracy curves, XP curve verification, catch rate review, biome encounter balance, shop pricing, edge case testing. Content-complete.

## Principles

- **Playable early, polished late.** Phase 3 should produce something a human can interact with. Every phase after that should keep the game playable.
- **Data-driven.** Critter stats, moves, items, type chart, biome encounter tables — all in JSON, not hardcoded. Tuning should never require recompilation.
- **Game logic separate from rendering.** Battle engine and dungeon engine must work and be testable without any UI. Screens are thin layers over game logic.
- **Don't over-engineer.** No ECS, no entity framework, no custom allocator pools unless a profiler says you need them. Structs, arrays, and functions.
- **One thing at a time.** Each phase has a clear deliverable. Don't leak scope between phases.
